# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This tool enables independent monitoring and verification of government contracting 
patterns. Users and contributors should conduct themselves responsibly when using 
or improving this watchdog tool.

## Standards for Use

### Responsible monitoring practices:

* **Verifying information** through multiple independent sources
* **Using evidence-based reasoning** in analysis
* **Distinguishing correlation from causation** in pattern detection
* Understanding that patterns indicate areas for scrutiny, not proof
* Maintaining proper security of monitoring data and credentials
* Respecting API rate limits and terms of service

### Unacceptable practices:

* **Making unfounded accusations** without verifiable evidence
* **Harassment of individuals** based on contract findings
* **Spreading misinformation** or misrepresenting data
* **Unlawful use** of this monitoring tool
* Violating API terms of service or rate limits
* Sharing others' monitoring data without permission

## Responsible Use of This Tool

This software enables independent monitoring and verification. Users must:

1. **Verify findings independently** - Pattern detection identifies areas for scrutiny
2. **Provide context** - Consider all relevant factors in analysis
3. **Maintain proper security** - Protect your monitoring data and credentials
4. **Respect API limits** - Follow government API terms of service
5. **Understand limitations** - This is one tool for individual oversight
6. **Act lawfully** - Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
7. **Use for verification** - This tool supports distributed accountability checks

## Enforcement

Maintainers reserve the right to remove, edit, or reject contributions that 
are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or that misuse the tool's monitoring 
capabilities.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

This includes:
- GitHub repository interactions (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Use of the software itself
- Public presentations or communications about the project
- Social media discussions related to the project

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the project
repository.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior, or misuse of the software for harassment.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for Monitoring Work

Given the nature of independent government contract monitoring:

### For Contributors:
- **Accuracy is paramount** - Verify your code and data collection methods
- **Document limitations** clearly
- **Consider edge cases** that might produce false positives
- Improve monitoring capabilities and detection accuracy

### For Users:
- **Understand limitations** - Pattern detection identifies areas for scrutiny
- **Verify independently** - Use multiple sources for verification
- **Maintain security** - Protect your monitoring data
- **Act lawfully** - This is a verification tool, not a weapon

### For Data Subjects:
If you believe this tool has incorrectly flagged legitimate activity:
- Open an issue with supporting documentation
- Corrections that improve accuracy are welcome
