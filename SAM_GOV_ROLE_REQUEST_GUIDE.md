## 🚨 Critical Importance

**This API access is the missing piece for your cronyism monitoring:**
- **Detect Kushner Companies** → subsidiary networks
- **Track shell companies** hiding Trump connections  
- **Map corporate ownership** structures
- **Monitor excluded vendors** and their workarounds

**Without this data, you can't trace money through corporate networks - which is essential for detecting sophisticated corruption schemes!**
