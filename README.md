# 🔍 Government Contract Cronyism Monitor

A comprehensive monitoring system designed to detect corruption patterns, cronyism, and preferential treatment in federal government contracting.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Before You Start

### 🔐 Security Requirements
1. **Never commit `token.txt`** - Your API token must stay private
2. **Get a SAM.gov API key** - Required (free): https://sam.gov/
3. **Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** - Important security guidelines

### 📋 First-Time Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone this repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd GSA

# 2. Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Set up your API token
cp token.txt.example token.txt
# Edit token.txt and add your SAM.gov API token

# 4. Verify setup
python3 monitor.py  # Choose option 4 for Quick Status
```

### ⚖️ Responsible Use
This tool provides **independent verification** capabilities. It detects patterns that may warrant investigation:
- ✅ Verify findings through multiple sources
- ✅ Understand that pattern detection requires context
- ✅ Use as one tool among many for oversight
- ✅ Document and archive suspicious patterns
- ⚠️ Patterns indicate areas for scrutiny, not proof of wrongdoing

2. **Data Collection Only** - Update database without analysis  
3. **Dashboard Only** - Launch web interface
4. **Quick Status** - Show system status

### Enhanced Dashboard
```bash
python3 enhanced_dashboard.py
```
Advanced cronyism-focused dashboard at: http://127.0.0.1:8080

### Original Dashboard
```bash
python3 scripts/run_dashboard.py
```
Classic interface at: http://127.0.0.1:8080

## 📊 What It Detects

### 🚨 Cronyism Patterns
- **Emergency Procurement** - Contracts bypassing competition under "crisis" pretexts
- **Rapid Accumulation** - Companies quickly receiving multiple contracts
- **Watchlist Companies** - Trump network, Big Tech, connected entities
- **No-Bid Contracts** - Sole-source awards without competition
- **Large Contract Alerts** - High-value deals requiring scrutiny

### 🎯 Specific Scenarios Monitored
1. **"National Emergency" Acceleration** - Crisis-justified contract acceleration
2. **"Economic Patriotism" Traps** - Patriotic branding masking preferential treatment
3. **"Information Sovereignty" Gambits** - Data/platform consolidation under security pretexts
4. **"Financial Security" Consolidation** - Banking/finance deals with regulatory advantages

3. Generate API key
4. Create `token.txt` file:
```bash
cp token.txt.example token.txt
# Edit token.txt and paste your API key
```
5. **NEVER commit token.txt to git** (automatically ignored)

## 🔄 Daily Operation

### Recommended Daily Workflow
```bash
python3 monitor.py
# Choose option 1: Full Cronyism Detection
```

### Automated Monitoring
Set up daily cron job:
```bash
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/GSA && python3 monitor.py >> collection.log 2>&1
```

### Manual Collection
```bash
python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'core')
from comprehensive_collector import UltimateGovernmentMonitor
monitor = UltimateGovernmentMonitor()
results = monitor.run_ultimate_collection()
print(f'Collected {results.get(\"new_contracts_saved\", 0)} contracts')
"
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Contracts Table
- award_id, recipient_name, award_amount
- awarding_agency, award_date, competition_type
- description, collected_date

### Alerts Table

- resolved, severity, risk_score

## 🔧 Configuration

### Email Alerts (Optional)
Edit `core/government_monitor_system.py`:
```python
email_config = {

monitor = GovernmentMonitor(email_config)
```

## 📝 Usage Examples

### Company Research
```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'core')
from government_monitor_system import GovernmentMonitor
monitor = GovernmentMonitor()
report = monitor.get_company_report("Palantir")
print(f"Total contracts: {report['summary']['total_contracts']}")
```

### Custom Analysis
```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('government_monitor.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
cursor.execute("""
    SELECT recipient_name, SUM(award_amount) 
    FROM contracts 
    WHERE awarding_agency LIKE '%Defense%'
    GROUP BY recipient_name 
    ORDER BY SUM(award_amount) DESC 
    LIMIT 10
""")
results = cursor.fetchall()
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Won't Start
```bash
# Check if port 8080 is in use
lsof -i :8080

# Kill existing process if needed
kill -9 <PID>
```

### No Data Collected
```bash
# Test API connection
python3 -c "
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.usaspending.gov/api/v2/')
print(f'API Status: {response.status_code}')
"
```

### Database Issues
```bash
# Check database
sqlite3 government_monitor.db ".tables"
sqlite3 government_monitor.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contracts;"
```
